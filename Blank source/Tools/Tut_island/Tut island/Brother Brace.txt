Good day, brother, my name's "Playername+"
//Brother Brace

Hello, Playername+. I'm Brother Brace. I'm here to tell
you all about prayer.
3.
This is you prayer list. Prayers can help a lot in
combat. Click on the prayer you wish to use to activate 
it, and click it again to deactivate it.
4.
Active Prayers will drain your prayer points, which
you can recharge by finding and altar or other holy spot
and praying there.
5.
As you noticed, mod enemies will drop bones when
defeated. Burying bones, by clicking on them in your
inventory, will gain you Prayer experience.
6.
I'm also the community officer 'round here, so it's my
job to tell you about your friends and ignore list.
7.
Good. now you have both menus open i'll tell you a
little about each. You can add people to either list by
clicking the add button then typing their name into the
box that appears.
8.
You remove people from the lists in the same way. If
you add someone to your ignore list they will not be
able to talk to you or send any form of message to 
you.
9.
Your friends list shows the online status of your
friends. Friends in red are offline, friends in green are
online and on the same server and friends in yellow
are online, but on a different server.

Are there rules on in-game behaviour?
//Brother Brace
10.
Yes, you should read the rules of conduct on the
website to make sure you do nothing to get yourself
banned.
11.
But in general, always try to be courteous to other
players - remember the people in the game are real
people with real feelings.
12.
If you go 'round being abusive or causing trouble your
charactor could end up being the one in trouble.

Okay. thanks, I'll bear that in mind.
