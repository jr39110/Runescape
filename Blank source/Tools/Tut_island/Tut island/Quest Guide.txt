//Quest Guide
1.
Ah. Welcome adventurer. I'm here to tell you all about
quests. Let's start by opening the quest side pannel.
2.
Now you have the journel open i'll tell you a bit about
it. At the moment all the quests are shown in red, which
means you have not started them yet.
3.
When you start a quest it will change colour to yellow,
and to green when you have finished. This is so you can
easily see what's complete, what's started, and whats left
to begin.
4.
The start of quests are easy to find. Look out for the
star icons on the minimap, just like the one you should 
see marking my houde.
5.
The quests themselves can vary greatly from collecting
beads to hunting down dragons. Generally quests are
started by talking to a non-player charactor like me,
and will involve a series of tasks. 
6.
There's not a lot more i can tell you about questing. 
you have to experience the thrill of it yourself to fully
understand. You may find some adventure in the caves
under my house.
