How you can make money? Quite.
5.
Well, there are three basic ways of making money here:
Combat, quests and trading. I will talk yo through each
of them very quickly.
6.
Lets start with combat as it is probably still fresh in
your mind. Many enemies, both human and monster,
will drop items when they die.
7.
Now, the next way to earn money quickly is by quests.
Many people on Runescape Have things they need 
doing, Which they will reward you for.
8.
By getting a high level in skills such as cooking, mining,
smithing or fishing, you can create or catch your own 
items and sell them for pure profit.

well, that about covers it. Come back if you'd like to go
over this again.
